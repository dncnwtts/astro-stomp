STOMP is a C++ library which has its origins in doing fast angular correlation statistics on galaxy data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.  After many revisions, it has generalized into a platform for doing fast spatial statistics on arbitrary spherical geometries using 10s of millions of points.  The current version exists as a C++ library as well as a SWIG-wrapped python library.
